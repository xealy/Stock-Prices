# Stock Prices
ReactJS-based application that acts as interface to stocks database

## Setup the Application
To setup the Stock Prices application install NPM using npm install

Then you can run the application in any web browser using npm start

NOTE: The API no longer works with the application

## Project Summary
As part of a university assignment at QUT React was used to design and develop the front end of a stocks application. Using an API to store and provide stocks and user details to the application a user is able to login and register an account or view the stocks as a guest. Depending on the users status they are able to view and access different levels of information. With the logged in user being able to view each stock in detail, specifying a date range to graphically view the stocks data in graphs and tables. Whereas the guest user is only able to see the most recent entry for each individual stock.

## Application Design
When designing the ‘Lunar Exchange’ web app specific detail was taken towards the overall design and layout of it. Whilst functionality is key, having a sleek and easy to use website can determine the success of a real world application. When looking at other stock market-based websites there is often a lack of design, with pages filled with statistics and charts making it overwhelming for the novice user. Using cool colour tones of purples and blues throughout and reoccurring minimal graphics the Stock Prices website appears uniform and easy to understand and navigate. To achieve this, ‘react-strap’ was implemented for features such as a navigation bar, and an external CSS file illustrated the overall styling theme of the pages.
